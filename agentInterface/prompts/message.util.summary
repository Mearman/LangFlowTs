This conversation is getting long. Can you recap the whole thing for yourself so you remember what we talked about?

Write ~100 words about the conversation you had with your partner. Include the following:

1. Actions taken and why
2. The goals you are aiming to achieve
3. Your thoughts at various points in the conversation to give more context
4. What the next steps are

Do not make it a transcript. It should be a summary of the conversation. You can use bullet points if you want. 
Short is best as long as all the important points are covered.
