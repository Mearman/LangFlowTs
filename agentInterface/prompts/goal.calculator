create a caluclator repository in python. 

The repository should take in simple strings such as "1 + 1" and return the result of the calculation. You should support the following operations: +, -, *, /, ^ along with parenthesis.

for example:
    
    "1 + 1" = 2
    "2 * ( 1 + 1 )" = 4
    "(2 ^ 4) + (2 - 1)" = 17

    
The repository should have testing support and be able to pass unit tests.
The repo should be able to be run from the command line and take in a string as an argument and return the result of the calculation.

You have not completed this until you run the tests and they pass. If you do not verify that the tests pass, you will not get credit for this assignment.
